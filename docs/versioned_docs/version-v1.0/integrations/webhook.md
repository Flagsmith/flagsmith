![Webhook](/img/integrations/webhook/webhook-logo.svg)

You can integrate Flagsmith with your own data warehouse using our Webhook integration. The integration automatically
sends the flag states for identified users as a webhook, to a URL you specify, for cohort analysis, A/B testing and
more. The process is as follows:

## Integration Setup

1. Write an endpoint that accepts the [JSON schema](#webhook-json-schema) defined below
2. Add the integration in Flagsmith, providing your URL created in the step above.
3. You can also provide a Secret which will be [hashed and included in the HTTP header](#webhook-signature). This will
   allow you to verify that the Webhook has come from Flagsmith.
4. All API calls generated by the Flagsmith SDK to the `Get Identity Flags` endpoint will send the a full set of flag
   evaluations, traits and segments for that particular user to your webhook URL.

## Webhook JSON Schema

Flagsmith will send a `POST` request to the Webhook url you provide, with the following payload in the body:

```json
{
 "flags": [
  {
   "enabled": false,
   "environment": 2,
   "feature": {
    "created_date": "2022-02-04T14:57:39.200798Z",
    "default_enabled": false,
    "description": null,
    "id": 1,
    "initial_value": null,
    "name": "12e12e",
    "type": "STANDARD"
   },
   "feature_segment": null,
   "feature_state_value": null,
   "id": 2,
   "identity": null
  },
  {
   "enabled": true,
   "environment": 2,
   "feature": {
    "created_date": "2022-02-04T14:57:44.244575Z",
    "default_enabled": true,
    "description": null,
    "id": 2,
    "initial_value": null,
    "name": "gggg",
    "type": "STANDARD"
   },
   "feature_segment": null,
   "feature_state_value": null,
   "id": 4,
   "identity": null
  }
 ],
 "identity": "user_test",
 "segments": [
  {
   "id": 1,
   "member": true,
   "name": "test_segment"
  }
 ],
 "traits": [
  {
   "id": 4,
   "trait_key": "222",
   "trait_value": 333
  },
  {
   "id": 5,
   "trait_key": "aaa",
   "trait_value": "bbb"
  }
 ]
}
```

## Use Case

Once the integration has been set up, you can start segmenting your data warehouse users based on the flags that they
saw and the Segments that they are a member of. This allows you to enrich the data within your warehouse through
Flagsmith.

## Webhook Signature

When your webhook secret is set, Flagsmith uses it to create a hash signature with each payload. This hash signature is
passed with each request under the X-Flagsmith-Signature header that you need to validate at your end

### Validating Signature

Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use request body (raw utf-8 encoded string) as the message and secret
(utf8 encoded) as the Key. Here is one example in Python:

```python
import hmac

secret = "my shared secret"

expected_signature = hmac.new(
    key=secret.encode(),
    msg=request_body,
    digestmod=hashlib.sha256,
).hexdigest()

received_signature = request["headers"]["x-flagsmith-signature"]
hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, received_signature) is True
```
