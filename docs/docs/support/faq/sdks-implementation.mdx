### In the React SDK, is it possible to separate the initialization, like in the Node.js API? 

Yes. You can use the `preventFetch` option in `flagsmith.init` to initialize without immediately fetching flags.

**Related documentation:** [JavaScript/React SDK](/integrating-with-flagsmith/sdks/client-side-sdks/javascript)


### Is the function startListening(ms) something that can "auto-fetch"? 
Yes. It polls the API for new flags every `ms` milliseconds. Note that this counts against your API request quota.

**Related documentation:** [JavaScript/React SDK](/integrating-with-flagsmith/sdks/client-side-sdks/javascript)


### Is there a way to await the response from the method bullettrain.identify()? 

Yes. The `identify()` method returns a Promise that resolves when the flags are fetched.

**Related documentation:** [JavaScript/React SDK](/integrating-with-flagsmith/sdks/client-side-sdks/javascript)


### When I query for feature flags what method / API should I be using to pass the user email address?

You use the `identify("user_email_here")` method in the SDK. The email acts as the Identity ID.

**Related documentation:** [Identities](/flagsmith-concepts/identities)


### Is there support for initializing a client that does not establish a network connection to Flagsmith? 

Yes. You can initialize the client with default flags or cache without calling `getFlags`.

**Related documentation:** [Local Evaluation Mode](/integrating-with-flagsmith/integration-overview#local-evaluation-mode)


### Do you support Python? 

Yes, there is an official Python SDK.

**Related documentation:** [Python SDK](/integrating-with-flagsmith/sdks/server-side#python)


### Does the Flagsmith .net SDK work with Unity 3D? 
Yes. It is built on .NET Standard 2.0 and is compatible with Unity.
