### Is there a user_created date? 

No. Flagsmith does not currently store an automatic `created_date` trait for users/identities.

**Related:** [Can I create common User Traits for all users in the same environment?](#can-i-create-common-user-traits-for-all-users-in-the-same-environment)



### Can I create common User Traits for all users in the same environment? 

No. Traits are specific to individual Identities (Users) and are created automatically when you identify the user in the SDK.

**Related documentation:** [Identities](/flagsmith-concepts/identities)


### How do I identify an anonymous user? What about running AB tests with anonymous users? 

You must generate a unique identifier (like a random GUID/hash) on your client side, store it (e.g., in a cookie), and pass it to the `identify` method. For A/B tests to be consistent, this ID must persist across sessions.

**Related documentation:** [Identities](/flagsmith-concepts/identities)


### When querying identities, is it possible to sort by creation date? 

No. Searching and sorting identities is currently in the backlog.


### Is there way to render traits in users list in your webUI? 

Not directly in the main list. You can view traits for a specific user by clicking into their profile, or view users belonging to a segment that is defined by traits.
