### If a segment is 'off' what does that mean? 

It means that for any user falling into that segment, the feature flag is forced to the **OFF** state (overriding the environment default).

**Related:** [Will a segment override work if the feature is toggled off?](#will-a-segment-override-work-if-the-feature-is-toggled-off)

**Related documentation:** [Segments](/flagsmith-concepts/segments)


### Will a segment override work if the feature is toggled off?

Yes. A segment override is evaluated regardless of the global environment on/off switch for that flag.

**Related:** [If a segment is 'off' what does that mean?](#if-a-segment-is-off-what-does-that-mean)


### How can I check which users belongs to which Segment? 

You can go to the **Segments** page in the UI and view the "Users" tab to see identities currently in that segment.

**Related:** [Can I view all the users in a segment?](#can-i-view-all-the-users-in-a-segment)

**Related documentation:** [Segments](/flagsmith-concepts/segments)


### Can I view all the users in a segment? 
Yes, via the method mentioned above.

**Related:** [How can I check which users belongs to which Segment?](#how-can-i-check-which-users-belongs-to-which-segment)



### Does the % split segment feature work for non-identified users? 

No. Percentage splits require a consistent Identity ID to hash against. Anonymous users must be assigned a generated ID for this to work.

**Related:** [How do I identify an anonymous user? What about running AB tests with anonymous users?](/support/faq/user-identity-management#how-do-i-identify-an-anonymous-user-what-about-running-ab-tests-with-anonymous-users)

**Related documentation:** [Segment Rule Operators](/flagsmith-concepts/segments/segment-rule-operators) • [Identities](/flagsmith-concepts/identities)


### When using a segment with "% split", would changing the value affect existing users? {#when-using-a-segment-with-split-would-changing-the-value-affect-existing-users}

No. The bucket is determined by hashing the Identity ID. As long as the percentage value and the User ID remain the same, the user stays in the same bucket.

**Related documentation:** [Segment Rule Operators](/flagsmith-concepts/segments/segment-rule-operators)



### Can I put a Segment inside a Segment?

No. Nested segments are not supported.

**Related:** [Is there a way to combine two conditions with 'AND' for Segments?](#is-there-a-way-to-combine-two-conditions-with-and-for-segments)


### Is there a way to combine two conditions with 'AND' for Segments? 
Yes. You can add multiple conditions within a segment rule, which function as AND logic.

**Related documentation:** [Segment Rule Operators](/flagsmith-concepts/segments/segment-rule-operators)


### What happens if I have the same user that is attached to two segments and have an opposite config on the same feature? 

**Related:** [Is it possible to set a flag that has complete precedent over all users & segments?](/support/faq/feature-flags-remote-config#is-it-possible-to-set-a-flag-that-has-complete-precedent-over-all-users--segments)

**Related documentation:** [Segments](/flagsmith-concepts/segments)


### Does Flagsmith allow me to incorporate user segmentation data (eg from mixpanel) to deploy flags based on user attributes?

**Via Integrations:** Yes, if you use **Segment.com** (the CDP) or **Amplitude**, Flagsmith has native integrations to sync identities/segments.

**Related documentation:** [Segment Integration](/third-party-integrations/analytics/segment) • [Amplitude Integration](/third-party-integrations/analytics/amplitude)


### Is it possible to export the users to a .CSV or something similar? 
No button exists in the UI. You must retrieve the users via the API to generate a CSV.

**Related:** [How can I check which users belongs to which Segment?](#how-can-i-check-which-users-belongs-to-which-segment)

**Related documentation:** [Flagsmith API Overview](/integrating-with-flagsmith/flagsmith-api-overview)
