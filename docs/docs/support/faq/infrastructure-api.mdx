### Where is Flagsmith hosted?

The SaaS version uses an Edge API replicated across **8 AWS regions** globally.

**Related documentation:** [Edge API](/performance/edge-api) • [Platform Architecture](/flagsmith-concepts/platform-architecture)



### What is the official base URI for the API?

For Client SDKs: `https://edge.api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/`

For Management/Admin: `https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/`

**Related documentation:** [Edge API Overview](/edge-api/overview) • [Flagsmith API Overview](/integrating-with-flagsmith/flagsmith-api-overview)



### How can I check in Flagsmith how many requests I've send to the service?

Go to **Organisation** > **Manage** > **Admin Settings**. There is a usage graph there.

**Related documentation:** [Billing & API Usage](/administration-and-security/billing-api-usage)



### Where can I find my Project ID?

It is visible in the URL of your project settings page, or via the network tab in your browser developer tools.

**Related documentation:** [Data Model](/flagsmith-concepts/data-model#projects)



### Where can I get the Flagsmith token for an Environment?

Go to the **Settings** page of the specific **Environment** in the dashboard.

**Related:** [Is it possible to create two keys in one environment and have different permissions?](/support/faq/feature-flags-remote-config#is-it-possible-to-create-two-keys-in-one-environment-and-have-different-permissions)



### What events can I send from Flagsmith into my own infrastructure?

You can configure **Webhooks** for *Flag Change* events and *Audit Log* events. There are no webhooks for individual User/Identity events.

**Related documentation:** [Webhooks](/third-party-integrations/webhook)


### How would I define an experiment for a subset of users based on existing traits in a CDP?

You would likely need to use the **Segment (CDP)** integration to push those traits into Flagsmith as Identity Traits, then create a Segment in Flagsmith based on those traits to target the experiment.

**Related:** [Does Flagsmith allow me to incorporate user segmentation data (eg from mixpanel) to deploy flags based on user attributes?](/support/faq/segments-targeting#does-flagsmith-allow-me-to-incorporate-user-segmentation-data-eg-from-mixpanel-to-deploy-flags-based-on-user-attributes)

**Related documentation:** [Segment Integration](/third-party-integrations/analytics/segment) • [Experimentation & A/B Testing](/experimentation-ab-testing)



### Is customer bucketing guaranteed in A/B tests over time to ensure their consistent system experience?

Yes. Bucketing is deterministic based on the Identity ID hash.

**Related:** [When using a segment with "% split", would changing the value affect existing users?](/support/faq/segments-targeting#when-using-a-segment-with-split-would-changing-the-value-affect-existing-users)
