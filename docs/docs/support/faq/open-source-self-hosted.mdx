### Does the Open Source version of Flagsmith have a limit of requests per month? 
No. There are no API limits on the self-hosted open-source version.

**Related documentation:** [Self-Hosting & Deployment](/deployment-self-hosting)


### Does the Open Source version of Flagsmith have any restrictions? 

Yes. While the majority of the code is BSD 3-Clause, the **Enterprise Edition** (EE) features—such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), SAML/SSO, and certain database integrations—are closed source and require a license.

**Related documentation:** [Enterprise Edition](/deployment-self-hosting/enterprise-edition) • [RBAC](/administration-and-security/access-control/rbac)



### Can the open source version be configured to connect to an LDAP server? 

Not out of the box. While the underlying Django framework supports it, there are no pre-built configurations for LDAP in the open-source version. Authentication integrations like SAML/Okta are Enterprise features.

### When deploying with Docker, how do I configure SES credentials? 

You configure them using standard AWS environment variables passed to the Docker container: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
