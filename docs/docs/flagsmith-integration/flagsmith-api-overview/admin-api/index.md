The Admin API allows you to programmatically manage your Flagsmith projects, environments, features, segments, and users. Essentially, any action you can perform in the Flagsmith dashboard can also be accomplished via the Admin API.

This API is designed for automation, integrations, and building custom workflows on top of Flagsmith.

## API Explorer

You can explore the full Admin API via Swagger at [https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/docs/](https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/docs/). You can also get the OpenAPI specification in [JSON](https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/docs/?format=.json) or [YAML](https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/docs/?format=.yaml) format.

We also have a [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/flagsmith/workspace/flagsmith/overview) that you can use to experiment with the API.
