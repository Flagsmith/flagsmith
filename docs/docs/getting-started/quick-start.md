# Flagsmith Quick Start Guide

This tutorial will guide you through the core concepts of integrating Flagsmith into your application.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Create a Project and your first Flag in the Flagsmith dashboard.
- Import the Flagsmith Javascript SDK into your web page.
- Connect to the Flagsmith API and retrieve your flags.
- Update your application's behaviour based on a flag's value.

## Prerequisites

You will need access to a Flagsmith instance (either using the SaaS platform or self-hosted) and a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript.

:::tip
If you're using the SaaS platform, log in at [Flagsmith.com](https://flagsmith.com/). If you're self-hosting, log in to your deployed instance.

## 1. Create a Project and Flag in the Dashboard

We are going to create an Organisation (if you have not already), a Project, and your first Flag.

![Create Organisation](/img/quickstart/demo_create_1.png)

Flagsmith manages Flags with Projects, so let's create one now:

![Create Project](/img/quickstart/demo_create_2.png)

Flagsmith organises Projects into separate Environments. When you create a Project, Flagsmith automatically creates `Development` and `Production` Environments. We will come to these Environments later. Let us go ahead and create our first Flag. This flag will control whether a button shows on our web page.

![Flagsmith Overview](/img/quickstart/demo_create_3.png)

Flags within Flagsmith are a combination of both: A Boolean value - the `Flag State` and then optionally: A String/Integer/Boolean value - the `Flag Value`. For now, we're only going to use the `Boolean` value of the flag to control whether the button shows. Create a flag called `show_demo_button`, and leave it as Disabled by default:

## 2. Import the Javascript SDK

Ok, so we have set up our flag; now let us bring it into our application. We have a (quite small!) web page:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Flagsmith Quickstart Guide</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <h1>Here's our button!</h1>
  <div id="submit_button">
   <input type="submit" value="Flagsmith Quickstart Button!" />
  </div>
 </body>
</html>
```

The page looks like this:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img width="75%" src="/img/quickstart/demo_create_8.png"/></div>

For the purposes of this quickstart tutorial, we will import the SDK inline into our web page:

<CodeBlock>{ `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flagsmith@`}<JsVersion />{`/index.js"></script>` } </CodeBlock>

## 3. Connect to the Flagsmith API

We can now connect to the Flagsmith API and get our Flags. When you initialise the Flagsmith SDK, you have to provide an Environment ID. This way, the SDK knows which Project and Environment to retrieve flags for. Head to the Environment Settings page within Flagsmith, and copy the API key:

![SDK Keys](/img/quickstart/demo_create_6.png)

Then paste your API key into the code below:

```html
<script>
 flagsmith.init({
  environmentID: '<add your API key here!>',
  onChange: (oldFlags, params) => {},
 });
</script>
```

Now when the browser opens the web page, it will download the Javascript SDK and make a call to `edge.api.flagsmith.com`
to get the flags for our Environment. You can see this in the browser network tab:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img width="75%" src="/img/quickstart/demo_create_7.png"/></div>

You can see here that the flag is being returned by the Flagsmith API and it has `"enabled": false` as the value.

## 4. Hook up our Application

Let's hook this value up to our button, so that the value of the flag controls whether the button is hidden or shown.

```html
<script>
 flagsmith.init({
  environmentID: '<add your API key here!>',
  onChange: (oldFlags, params) => {
   if (flagsmith.hasFeature('show_demo_button')) {
    var submit_button = document.getElementById('submit_button');
    submit_button.style.display = 'block';
   }
  },
 });
</script>
```

This code sets up a callback, which is triggered when we get a response back from the Flagsmith API. We will check for
the state of the flag and set the display visibility based on the result.

Our entire web page now reads like this:

<CodeBlock>{ `<!doctype html>

<html lang="en">
 <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <title>Flagsmith Quickstart Guide</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flagsmith@`}<JsVersion />{`/index.js"></script>
  <script>
   flagsmith.init({
    environmentID: 'ZfmJTbLQZrhZVHkVhXbsNi',
    onChange: (oldFlags, params) => {
     if (flagsmith.hasFeature('show_demo_button')) {
      var submit_button = document.getElementById('submit_button');
      submit_button.style.display = 'block';
     }
    },
   });
  </script>
 </head>
 <body>
  <h1>Here's our button!</h1>
  <div id="submit_button" style="display:none">
   <input type="submit" value="Flagsmith Quickstart Button!" />
  </div>
 </body>
</html>`}
</CodeBlock>

If we go back and refresh our browser, you will see that the button has now disappeared.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img width="75%" src="/img/quickstart/demo_create_9.png"/></div>

We've now put the control of the button visibility behind our Flagsmith Flag! You can now go back to the Flagsmith
dashboard and enable the flag:

![Flag View](/img/quickstart/demo_create_10.png)

Return to your browser, refresh the page, and the button will reappear.

## Finishing Up

This was a pretty quick demo, but it covers the core concepts involved in integrating Flagsmith into your application.
From here, some areas of the documentation you might want to check out are:

- A deeper overview of the application - [Features](basic-features/managing-features.md),
  [Identities](basic-features/managing-identities.md) and [Segments](basic-features/segments.md).
- More details about our [API and SDKs](clients/rest.md).
- How you can [run Flagsmith yourself](/deployment) or use our [Hosted API](https://flagsmith.com/).
