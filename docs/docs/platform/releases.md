- Sensible page size for the users page

The remote config to use this is as follows:

```json
integration_data
{
    "perEnvironment": false,
    "image": "https://xyz",
    "fields": [
      {
        "key": "base_url",
        "label": "Base URL"
      },
      {
        "key": "api_key",
        "label": "API Key"
      }
    ],
    "tags": [
      "logging"
    ],

}
```
