# Feature Flags - An Overview


Feature flags enable fine-grained control over your application's functionality. They allow you to:

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--4">
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <h3>ðŸš€ Deploy Safely</h3>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        Ship code to production behind feature flags and control its rollout from the dashboard.
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  </div>
  
  <div className="col col--4">
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <h3>ðŸ”¬ Test in Production</h3>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        Enable features for specific users, segments, or environments to gather real-world feedback.
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  </div>
  
  <div className="col col--4">
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <h3>âš¡ Move Fast</h3>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        Decouple deployment from release to ship code more frequently with less risk.

## Core Concepts

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Organization] --> B[Projects]
    B --> C[Environments]
    C --> D[Features]
    D --> E[Feature Flags]
    D --> F[Remote Config]
    C --> G[Identities]
    G --> H[Traits]
    G --> I[Segments]
```

### Organizations and Projects
Organizations are containers for your projects and team members. Projects help you organize related features and environments.

```mermaid

    A[Organization] --> B[Team Management]
    A --> C[Projects]
    C --> D[Development]
    C --> E[Staging]
    C --> F[Production]
```

### Environments and Features
Features are shared across environments but can have different states in each one:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Feature] --> B[Development: ON]
    A --> C[Staging: ON]
    A --> D[Production: OFF]
```

### Identities, Traits and Segments

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--4">
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <h3>ðŸ‘¤ Identities</h3>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        Individual users in your application. Each environment has its own set of identities.
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  </div>
  
  <div className="col col--4">
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <h3>ðŸ“Š Traits</h3>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        Key-value pairs storing user data like preferences, usage stats, or custom attributes.
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  </div>
  
  <div className="col col--4">
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Segments</h3>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        Groups of users defined by their traits, enabling targeted feature rollouts.
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  </div>
