The import and export of feature data associated with a given environment is possible on Flagsmith. The feature data
that's exported includes multivariate features, but does not include other data that's associated with tags, owners,
group owners, etc. It's useful for transferring features between any running instances of Flagsmith, even when only a
subset of features (e.g., importing features of a given tag) are needed.

## What is exported?

We **will** export the following data:

- Flags
- Flag States (both boolean and text values)
- Multivariate values and weights

We **will not** export the following data:

- Feature-based Segments
- Segment overrides
- Flag [custom fields](/advanced-use/custom-fields.md)
- Flag Schedules
- Tags associated with Flags
- Individual and group owners associated with Flags

## Exporting

On the Export tab of the project settings page it is possible to export the project's features using the environment's
values. Simply select the source environment from the drop down list and, if required, select one or more feature tags
to filter the features.

By tapping the Export Features button the feature export should quickly process and a list of processed features exports
is available at the bottom of the page.

:::tip

Feature exports are available for only two weeks, so if an export is needed for a longer period of time be sure to make
a local backup.

## Importing

On the Import tab of the project settings page you'll find the feature import functionality complete with file upload at
the bottom of the page.

:::caution

The target environment is the environment to inherit the features of the exported environment. All other environments
will be set to the values defined when the feature was initially created. Use with caution, especially when using with
the Overwrite Destructive merge strategy.

### Merge Strategy

Since a feature may have an identical name it's important to carefully select a merge strategy during a feature import.

The first option is the Skip strategy which allows an import to process a feature export and at any time a feature has a
pre-existing feature present it skips the import for that given feature. For example, if a user is importing ten
features but two of them were already there, only eight features will be added to the project. This strategy is best for
organisations that want to hold onto their existing data as close as possible.

The second option is the Overwrite Destructive strategy. In contrast to the Skip strategy the Overwrite Destructive
method clobbers over your existing features and it's important to remember that this is across all environments. This
strategy is most useful only when every feature that was included in the export was vetted to be authoritative in the
target project.
