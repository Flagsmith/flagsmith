title: SAML single sign-on (SSO)
---

:::info

SAML single sign-on requires an [Enterprise subscription](https://flagsmith.com/pricing).

:::

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a standard authentication and authorisation system. You can connect
your existing identity provider to Flagsmith using SAML 2.0, which lets your users log in to your Flagsmith organisation
using their existing credentials.

SAML single sign-on also lets Flagsmith use the existing user groups from your identity provider. This lets you assign
permissions to your Flagsmith users directly from their identity provider groups, and not have to manage group
membership from Flagsmith.

## Prerequisites and limitations

Make sure your Flagsmith organisation has an active Enterprise licence.

If you have preexisting Flagsmith users that use other authentication methods such as email and password, GitHub or
Google, and you later set up SSO for these users, Flagsmith will see them as the same user as long as their email is
the same (case-insensitive). All Flagsmith data including permissions are preserved as long as the email addresses match
between SSO and non-SSO users.

Users that log in using SSO can only belong to one Flagsmith organisation. If a user tries to log in with SSO, and they
belong to more than one Flagsmith organisation, they will not be able to log in using SSO until they are removed from
all other organisations. These users can still log in using a non-SSO method and remove themselves from the other
organisations if they choose.

If you are self-hosting Flagsmith, TLS is required. Encrypted SAML assertions are not supported.

## Setup

:::tip

If your identity provider is Okta, use the [Flagsmith Okta application](/system-administration/authentication/Okta)
instead of following these steps.

:::

This is an overview of the steps required to configure SAML SSO:

1. Create a Flagsmith SAML configuration.
2. Add your identity provider's SAML metadata to this Flagsmith SAML configuration.
3. Add your Flagsmith SAML configuration's service provider metadata to your identity provider.
4. Optional: Add external IDs to your Flagsmith groups to map your identity provider groups to Flagsmith groups.

You can manage your Flagsmith SAML configurations from the Flagsmith dashboard. Click on your Flagsmith organisation
name in the top left, then go to **Organisation Settings** > **SAML**.

You can create multiple SAML configurations if you have multiple identity providers. In most cases, you will only
need one.

When creating a SAML configuration, the following options are available:

**Name:** (**Required**) A unique, URL-friendly name for the SAML configuration. This name must be unique across all
Flagsmith organisations and forms part of the URL that your identity provider will post SAML messages to during
authentication. Users must type this name when clicking "Single Sign-On" at the login screen. It cannot be changed after
the SAML configuration is created.

**Frontend URL**: (**Required**) The base URL of the Flagsmith dashboard. Users will be redirected here
after authenticating successfully.

**Allow IdP-initiated**: If enabled, users will be able to log in directly from your identity provider without needing
to visit the Flagsmith login page.

**IdP metadata XML**: The SAML metadata from your identity provider. This typically includes information such as your
identity provider's public key for SAML assertions. If you do not have this metadata yet, you can create the SAML
configuration without it and come back to this step later.

Once your Flagsmith SAML configuration is created, you can download its SAML metadata by clicking "Download Service
Provider Metadata". Add this file to your identity provider to establish a trust relationship between it and Flagsmith.

### Assertion consumer service URL

Each Flagsmith SAML configuration has its own Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, also known as single sign-on URL.
Your identity provider will post SAML messages to this URL when a user logs in using SSO. The ACS URL for any
SAML configuration is as follows, replacing `flagsmith.example.com` with your Flagsmith API's domain:

```
https://flagsmith.example.com/api/v1/auth/saml/YOUR_SAML_CONFIGURATION_NAME/response/
```

## Attribute mapping

Flagsmith will look for the following SAML attributes, in order, to uniquely identify a SAML user:

- `subject-id`
- `uid`
- `NameID`

Flagsmith also maps user attributes from the following claims in the SAML assertion:

| Flagsmith attribute | Identity provider claim names                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Email               | `mail`, `email` or `emailAddress`                    |
| First name          | `gn`, `givenName` or the first part of `displayName` |
| Last name           | `sn`, `surname` or the second part of `displayName`  |
| Groups              | `groups`                                             |

To add custom attribute mappings, edit your SAML configuration and open the **Attribute Mappings** tab. For example,
this mapping tells Flagsmith to look for user groups in a claim other than the default `groups` claim:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img width="75%" src="/img/saml-group-mapping.png"/></div>

## Permissions for SAML users

By default, users logging in via SAML will have no permissions to view or modify anything in the Flagsmith dashboard.
You can customise this by creating a [group](/system-administration/rbac) with the "Add new users by default" option
enabled, and assigning your desired default permissions to that group.

### Using groups from your identity provider

Flagsmith can add or remove a user from groups based on your identity provider's SAML response when logging in.

When a user logs in, Flagsmith will make them a member of all the groups listed in the `groups` claim from your identity
provider's SAML assertion. Each value of the `groups` claim should correspond to the "External ID" of a Flagsmith group:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}><img width="75%" src="/img/saml-group-sync-external-id.png"/></div>

For example, a SAML assertion with the following `groups` claim would assign the user to the Flagsmith groups with
external IDs of `my_group` and `my_other_group`:

```xml
<saml2:Attribute Name="groups">
  <saml2:AttributeValue xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="xs:anyType">
        my_group
    </saml2:AttributeValue>
  <saml2:AttributeValue xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="xs:anyType">
        my_other_group
    </saml2:AttributeValue>
</saml2:Attribute>
```

By default, this claim must be named exactly `groups`. Some identity providers such as Microsoft Entra ID add a
namespace to their claims such as `http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groups`. If this is the case,
or your groups claim has a different name, you must tell Flagsmith which claim it should look at by [creating an
attribute mapping](#attribute-mapping).

## Force users to log in with SSO

Once you have confirmed your SAML configuration is working, you can prevent users logging in using other authentication
methods with any of these options:

* [Restrict authentication methods per email domain](/system-administration/authentication#domain-auth).
* If you have a private Flagsmith instance,
[disable password authentication](/system-administration/authentication#disable-password).

## Always use a specific SAML configuration

When a user clicks on "Single Sign-On" at the Flagsmith login screen, they will be prompted to enter the name of a
SAML configuration. If you are self-hosting Flagsmith, you can skip this step and always use a specific SAML
configuration by setting up the `sso_idp`
[Flagsmith-on-Flagsmith](https://docs.flagsmith.com/deployment#running-flagsmith-on-flagsmith) flag. The text value of
this flag should be the name of the SAML configuration to use.

If you are using Flagsmith private cloud, contact Flagsmith support once you have created your SAML configuration and
validated it works correctly.

## Canonicalization methods

Some identity providers require the service provider to support canonicalization methods that are not allowed by
default. You can see the methods that are enabled by default
[here](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/blob/88feeba03c2f891a31a86cbb24b210070aab1fdc/src/saml2/xmldsig/__init__.py#L67-L70).

You can enable additional canonicalization methods by setting the `EXTRA_ALLOWED_CANONICALIZATIONS` environment variable
to a comma-separated list of canonicalization method URIs. For example:

```sh
EXTRA_ALLOWED_CANONICALIZATIONS=http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#,http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#WithComments
```

## Force SSL after authentication

You can configure Flagsmith to ignore the `X-Forwarded-Proto` HTTP header and always use HTTPS for the ACS URL by
setting the `SAML_FORCE_SSL` environment variable to `True`.

## Troubleshooting

If you need to contact Flagsmith support or an administrator for help with SSO logins, the best way is to record and
share a
[HAR file](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828867098-Generating-a-HAR-file-for-troubleshooting)
from your web browser where you try to log in to Flagsmith using your SAML identity provider.
