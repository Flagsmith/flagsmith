You can import and export your data between Flagsmith organisations, instances, or other feature flagging services.

We recommend understanding the [Flagsmith data model](/basic-features/#flagsmith-model) before importing or 
exporting any data.

## Flagsmith import/export

There are several ways of importing or exporting Flagsmith data:

* [Bulk feature import/export](bulk-import-and-export). Copy all or a subset of features 
  between Flagsmith projects.
* [Organisation import/export](organisations-import-export). Export an entire 
  Flagsmith organisation and copy it to a different Flagsmith instance.
* Use the [Admin API](/clients/rest#private-admin-api-endpoints) to manually manage your Flagsmith data.

## Import from third-party services

You can [import LaunchDarkly flags and segments](import-from-launchdarkly) into Flagsmith.
