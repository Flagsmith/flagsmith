Organisation settings page and clicking on **Usage**. You can also drill down into Projects and Environments. Flagsmith
tracks the following request types:

1. Get Flags
2. Get Identity Flags
3. Set Identity Traits
4. Get [Environment Document](/clients#the-environment-document) (for local evaluation SDKs)
