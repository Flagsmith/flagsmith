Feature Flags generally have two lifecycles:

1. Short-Lived Flags
2. Long-Lived Flags

Lets go over each type in detail.

## Short-Lived Flags

Short-lived flags are designed to be removed from your code and from Flagsmith at some point in the future. Their typical lifecycle is normally something like:

1. Create flag in Flagsmith.
2. Add the flag to your application's code.
3. Toggle the flag and/or apply Segment overrides to control your application's behaviour.
4. Once you are finished with the flag, remove it from your codebase.
5. Deploy your application, so that there is no reference to the flag.
6. Remove the flag from Flagsmith.

Short lived flags are typically used for the following use-scenarios:

### Feature Roll-Outs

The most common use of flags in general is to decouple the deployment of a feature from its release. When using a flag to achieve this, you will generally remove it from your code and from Flagsmith once you are happy with the feature and it is rolled out to all your users.

Once that's done, there is no reason to have the flag existing either in Flagsmith or your code, hence it is considered good practise to remove it from both.

### Experimentation

You can use Multi-variate flags to drive [A/B and multivariate tests](/experimentation/ab-testing). Once your experiment is complete, there is typically no need for the flag to remain, and hence it can be removed.

## Long-Lived Flags

Conversely, sometimes you will create flags that are long-lived - quite possibly for the lifetime of the application. Here are a few use cases where this approach can be used.

### Kill Switches

There are often times where you need to be remotely remove a feature, area of your application or sometimes the application as a whole (in the event of a large deployment, for example). In these instances, flags can be used as 'kill switches' to remove a feature altogether, or maybe to prevent users from using the application in the event of downtime.

Kill switches are generally long-lived; they often exist in the event of an unexpected event or error, and so they need to be long-lived in case they need to be put to use.

### Feature Management Flags

You can make use of [Segments](/flagsmith-concepts/segments) and Flags to control how different features are enabled or disabled depending on the user. For example, you can send a Trait `plan` with the relevant user value (e.g. `scale-up`) to Flagsmith, then create a Segment that defines all users on the `scale-up` plan. You can then show or hide features based on this Segment and plan.

When employing feature flags in this manner, generally you would never remove this Flag or Segment, as you are using them to drive platform features for the lifetime of the application.

## Why use a dedicated feature flag service?

Using a dedicated feature flag service like Flagsmith offers numerous advantages over building an in-house solution. A dedicated service provides a robust, reliable, and scalable platform for managing feature flags, allowing you to focus on your core product development.

With a service like Flagsmith, you get:
- A user-friendly interface for managing flags, environments, and user segments.
- SDKs for various languages and frameworks, simplifying integration.
- Advanced features like staged rollouts, A/B testing, and remote configuration.
- A secure and scalable infrastructure, ensuring high availability and low latency.

## How does Flagsmith help?

Flagsmith is designed to help you implement best practices for feature flag management. It provides a comprehensive set of tools to manage the entire lifecycle of your feature flags.

With Flagsmith, you can:

- **Organise flags:** Use projects and environments to manage flags for different applications and deployment stages.
- **Control flag access:** Use role-based access control to manage who can view and modify flags.
- **Automate flag changes:** Schedule flag changes to coincide with releases or other events.
- **Track flag usage:** Use analytics to understand how your flags are being used and to identify any potential issues.
- **Integrate with your existing tools:** Flagsmith integrates with a wide range of tools, including CI/CD pipelines, monitoring and alerting systems, and more.
