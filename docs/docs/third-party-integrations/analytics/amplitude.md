You can integrate Flagsmith with Amplitude. You can automate AB tests by connecting the Flagsmith platform with
Amplitude. The process is as follows:

## Integration Setup

1. Get the Amplitude API key for your Amplitude project from the Amplitude Project page (Settings > Projects > Your
   Project > General tab)
2. Add the Amplitude API key into Flagsmith (Integrations > Add Amplitude Integration)
3. Set the Base URL relevant to your Amplitude project: `https://api2.amplitude.com` or `https://api.eu.amplitude.com`
   depending on whether you are using the US or EU region. Do _not_ include a trailing slash - copy and paste the urls
   as they appear here.
4. All API calls generated by the Flagsmith SDK to the `Get Identity Flags` endpoint will send a full set of flag
   evaluations for that particular user to the Amplitude
   [`Identify` endpoint](https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/identify-api)

## How it Works

:::tip

For flags that contain remote config values, Flagsmith will pass the value of the flag to Amplitude if the flag is
`enabled`. If the flag has no remote config value, Flagsmith will just pass the boolean state for the flag.

:::

Identity flag values are passed into Amplitude. If we make the call to the Flagsmith API to get the flags for an
Identity:

```bash
curl 'https://edge.api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/identities/?identifier=development_user_123456' \
  -H 'X-Environment-Key: 8KzETdDeMY7xkqkSkY3Gsg'
```

And then take a look in our Amplitude dashboard, you can see the user and the flag data that has been sent to the
Amplitude platform.

## Use Case

Once the integration has been set up, you can start segmenting your Amplitude identities based on the flags that they
saw. This means you can run AB tests driven by Flagsmith segments, and have the data show up automatically in Amplitude.

## Integration Notes

You have to identify users on both platforms in the same way. The Flagsmith `Identity ID` must be the same as the
Amplitude `user_id`.
