You can integrate Flagsmith with RudderStack. Send your Identity flag states into RudderStack for further downstream
analysis.

## Integration Setup

1. Get the RudderStack API key for your RudderStack project. Add an _HTTP API_ source, and make a note of the
   `Write Key`.
2. Make a note of the RudderStack _Data Plane URL_.
3. Go to your Flagsmith project, and click Integrations. Add the RudderStack Integration.
4. Paste the `Write Key` from step 1 into the API Key field in Flagsmith. Select the Flagsmith Environment that you want
   to send events from. Then hit Save.
5. All API calls generated by the Flagsmith SDK to the `Get Identity Flags` endpoint will send the a full set of flag
   evaluations for that particular user to RudderStack.

## How it Works

:::tip

For flags that contain remote config values, Flagsmith will pass the value of the flag to RudderStack if the flag is
`enabled`. If the flag has no remote config value, Flagsmith will just pass the boolean state for the flag.

:::

Identity flag values are passed into RudderStack. If we make the call to the Flagsmith API to get the flags for an
Identity:

```bash
curl 'https://edge.api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/identities/?identifier=development_user_123456' \
  -H 'X-Environment-Key: 8KzETdDeMY7xkqkSkY3Gsg'
```

And then take a look in our RudderStack dashboard, you can see the user and the flag data that has been sent to the
RudderStack platform.

## Use Case

Once the integration has been set up, you can start segmenting your RudderStack identities based on the flags that they
saw. This means you can run AB tests driven by Flagsmith segments, and have the data show up automatically in
RudderStack.

## Integration Notes

You have to identify users on both platforms in the same way. The Flagsmith `Identity ID` must be the same as the
RudderStack `user_id`.
