title: A/B Testing
---

A/B testing enables you to experiment with design and functionality variants of your application. The data generated
will allow you to make modifications to your app, safe in the knowledge that it will have a net positive effect.

You can use Flagsmith to perform A/B Tests. Using a combination of
[Multivariate Flags](/basic-features/managing-features.md#multi-variate-flags) and a 3rd party analytics tool like
[Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) or [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/), you can easily perform complex A/B tests that
will help improve your product.

Running AB tests require two main components: a bucketing engine and an analytics platform. The bucketing engine is used
to put users into a particular AB testing bucket. These buckets will control the specific user experience that is being
tested. The analytics platform will receive a stream of event data derived from the behaviour of the user. Combining
these two concepts allows you to deliver seamless AB test.

We have [integrations](/integrations) with a number of analytics platforms. If we don't integrate with the platform you
are using, you can still manually send the test data to the downstream platform manually.

## Overview - Testing a new Paypal button

For this example, lets assume we have an app that currently accepts Credit Card payments only. We have a hunch that we
are losing out on potential customers that would like to pay with Paypal. We're going to test whether adding Paypal to
the payment options increases our checkout rate.

We have a lot of users on our platform, so we don't want to run this test against our entire user-base. We want 90% of
our users to be excluded from the test. Then for our test, 5% of our users will see the new Paypal button, and the
remaining 5% will not see it. So we will have 3 buckets:

1. Excluded (Control) Users
2. Paypal Test Button Users
3. Test users that don't see the Paypal Button

Because Flagsmith Flags can contain both boolean states as well as multivariate flag values, we can make use of both. We
will use the boolean flag state to control whether to run the test. Then, if the flag is `enabled`, check the
Multivariate value. In this example, we will only show the Paypal button if the value is set to `show`.

## Creating the Test

In order to perform the A/B Test, we need to complete the following steps:

1. Create a new [Multivariate Flag](/basic-features/managing-features.md#multi-variate-flags) that will control which of
   the 3 buckets the user is put into. We'll call this flag `paypal_button_test`. We will provide 3 variate options:

   1. Control - 90% of users
   2. Paypal Button - 5% of users
   3. Test users that don't see the Paypal Button - 5% of users

2. In our app, we want to [identify](/basic-features/managing-identities.md) each user before they start the checkout
   process. All Flagsmith Multivariate flags need us to identify the user, so we can bucket them in a reproducible
   manner.
3. When we get to the checkout page, check the `value` of the `paypal_button_test` flag for that user. If it evaluates
   to `show`, show the Paypal payment button. Otherwise, don't show the button.
4. Send an event message to the analytics platform, adding the name/value pair of `paypal_button_test` and the value of
   the flag; in this case it would be one of either `control`, `show` or `hide`.
5. Deploy our app, enable the flag and watch the data come in to your analytics platform.

Here is what creating the Flag would look like.

## Evaluating the Test

Once the test is set up, and the flag has been enabled, data will start streaming into the analytics platform. We can
now evaluate the results of the tests based on the behavioral changes that the new button has created.

## Anonymous/Unknown Identities

To do A/B testing you need to use Identities. Without an Identity to key from, it's impossible for the platform to serve
a consistent experience to your users.

What if you want to run an A/B test in an area of your application where you don't know who your users are? For example
on the homepage of your website? In this instance, you need to generate _Anonymous Identities_ values for your users. In
this case we will generate a _GUID_ for each user.

A _GUID_ value is just a random string that has an extremely high likelihood of being unique. There's more info about
generating GUID values [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2117523).

The general flow would be:

1. A new browser visits your website homepage for the first time.
2. You see that this is an anonymous user, so you generate a random _GUID_ for that user and assign it to them.
3. You send that GUID along with an Identify call to Flagsmith. This will then segment that visitor.
4. You add a cookie to the browser and store the GUID. That way, if the user returns to your page, they will still be in
   the same segment.

These techniques will be slightly different depending on what platform you are developing for, but the general concept
will remain the same.
