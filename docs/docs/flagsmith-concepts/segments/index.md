# Segments

A segment is a subset of [identities](/flagsmith-concepts/identities), defined by a set of rules that match identity [traits](/flagsmith-concepts/identities#identity-traits). An identity always belongs to a single environment and can belong to any number of segments.

Once you have defined a segment, you can create **segment overrides** for features within an environment. A segment override allows you to control the state of a feature only for identities that belong to a specific segment. This is similar to how [identity overrides](/flagsmith-concepts/identities#identity-overrides) let you control the state of features for an explicit set of identities that is known in advance.

Because segments are driven by identity traits, your application must identify the user when retrieving flags in order for segment overrides to be applied. If your user is not identified, no overrides will be applied and all flags will be returned exactly as they are defined in the current environment.

Segments and segment overrides can be used to implement many scenarios. For example:

- Test features in production before they are released by overriding them only for internal users or a QA team.
- Deliver features only to "power users" who have logged in a certain number of times, have used specific functionality within your application, or any combination of factors.
- Force a group of users into a specific [A/B test](/experimentation-ab-testing) variation by overriding weightings on [multivariate flags](/managing-flags/core-management).
- Override behaviour based on the [application version number](/best-practices/mobile-app-versioning), e.g. by using the SemVer rule operators.
- Control features based on the time of day, date, weekday, etc. by passing it as a trait when evaluating flags for an identity.

## Security and privacy

The Flagsmith API to set user traits, e.g. the `setTraits` method from the JavaScript SDK, does not require authentication or credentials. This means that users can change their own traits, which could be a security problem if you are using segments for authorisation or access control. If you must use segments for access control, make sure to disable the ["Persist traits when using client-side SDK keys" option](/administration-and-security/governance-and-compliance/security) on every environment that needs it, and use server-side SDKs to set traits instead. You can still use client-side SDKs to read traits and flags derived from segments in this case.

Segment names and definitions might include sensitive or proprietary information that you do not wish to expose to your users. Because of this, segments are transparent to applications and are not included in API responses when using [remote evaluation mode](/integrating-with-flagsmith/sdks/server-side#when-running-in-remote-evaluation-mode).


Segment definitions _are_ served to clients running in [local evaluation mode](/integrating-with-flagsmith/sdks/server-side#when-running-in-local-evaluation-mode), as this allows them to calculate segments without making requests to the Flagsmith API. This is only an implementation detail and no segment information is exposed when retrieving flags using any SDK method.

## Creating project or feature-specific segments

Segments created from the segments page of the Flagsmith dashboard can be used to override any feature within a single project.

To create a segment override, click on a feature in a specific environment and go to the segment overrides tab.

If you need to create a segment that will only ever be used to override a single feature, you can create a **feature-specific segment** by clicking on "Create Feature-Specific Segment" when creating a segment override. Feature-specific segments are otherwise functionally identical to project segments. By default, feature-specific segments are not shown in the Segments page, unless you enable the "Include Feature-Specific" option.

Once created, project segments cannot be changed into feature-specific segments or vice versa.

## Order of rules within segments

Segment rules are evaluated in order, i.e. from top to bottom when viewed in the Flagsmith dashboard.

For example, consider the following segment:

1. 10% percentage split
2. `is_subscriber = true`

This segment would first select 10% of _all_ identities, and then choose subscribers from that cohort. Instead, if we used the opposite order:

1. `is_subscriber = true`
2. 10% percentage split

This would first select all subscriber identities, and then randomly choose 10% of them.

## Multiple segment overrides for one feature

If a feature has multiple segment overrides, they are evaluated in order, i.e. from top to bottom when viewed in the Flagsmith dashboard. The first matching override will be used to determine the state of a feature for a given identity.

## Flag evaluation precedence

Identity overrides always take precedence over segment overrides. Simply put, the order of precedence when evaluating a flag is:

1. Identity overrides
2. Segment overrides
3. Default value for the current environment

## Context values

:::warning

Currently, context values are only available for remote evaluation. In local evaluation, rules using context values will evaluate to `false`.

:::

In addition to identity [traits](/flagsmith-concepts/identities#identity-traits), you can use the following context values as Segment rule properties. For more information about identities and traits, see the [Identities documentation](/flagsmith-concepts/identities).

- **Identifier**: a unique identifier for an identity, used for segment and multivariate feature flag targeting, and displayed in the Flagsmith UI. Useful for bucketing via the [`% Split`](./segment-rule-operators#percentage-split) operator, or managing a list of users via the [`In`](./segment-rule-operators#in) operator.
- **Identity Key**: a key used when selecting a value for a multivariate feature, or for % split segmentation. Set to an internal identifier or a composite value based on the environment key and identifier, depending on Flagsmith implementation.
- **Environment Name**: an environment's human-readable name. Useful for restricting Segments to certain environments.

Context values can be used to control your targeting more precisely:

### Gradual rollout across tenants

Suppose your application supports users who can belong to multiple organisations. Now, you want to roll out a new feature to 20% of your organisations, ensuring that users only have access to the feature when they are part of an organisation included in that 20%. If they switch to an organisation outside this group, they will no longer have access to the feature.

Here's how you might define a segment to achieve this:

| Rule Order | Property                  | Operator | Value |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1          | `organisation_name` Trait | % Split  | 20    |

This setup, along with a segment override, instructs the evaluation engine to enable the feature if the user's current organisation belongs to consistent 20% of all organisations.

:::info Use transient traits for multi-tenancy

To avoid persisting the `organisation_name` trait on the user identity, mark it as [transient](/flagsmith-concepts/identities#transient-traits).

:::

### Restrict evaluation to select environments

Segments and segment overrides are defined at the project level. This means they apply across all environments, so you may want to restrict your targeting to specific environments â€” for example, to avoid exposing features in production while still running complex evaluations in staging or development.

Here's how you could define such a segment:

| Rule Order | Property         | Operator            | Value        |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 1          | Environment Name | Does Not Match (!=) | `production` |
| 2          | Identifier       | % Split             | 20           |

This setup will enable the feature for 20% of users, but only in non-production environments.

## Trait data types

Each individual trait value is always stored as one of the following data types:

- String.
- Boolean.
- Integer.
- Float.

Values in segment rules, on the other hand, are always stored as strings. When segment rules are evaluated, rule values will be coerced to be the same type as the trait value. If the rule value cannot be coerced, that rule will evaluate as false. This provides some flexibility if you ever need to change the data type of a trait, e.g. from boolean to string, while maintaining backwards and forwards compatibility in your application.

For example, consider the following code using the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
flagsmith.identify('example_user_1234');
flagsmith.setTrait('accepted_cookies', true);
```

The value of the `accepted_cookies` trait will be stored as a boolean for this identity. If you define a segment rule like `accepted_cookies = true`, the rule value `true` is stored as a string. Because the `accepted_cookies` was stored as a boolean for this identity, the segment engine will coerce the rule's string value into a boolean, and things will work as expected.

Suppose later on you needed to store a third possible state for the trait `accepted_cookies`, for example if users can partially accept cookies. Your application can start storing this trait as a string without needing to modify your existing segment:

```javascript
flagsmith.setTrait('accepted_cookies', 'partial');
```

This would continue to work as expected for identities that already have this trait set as a string value. Always storing the trait as a string would also work, for example:

```javascript
flagsmith.setTrait('accepted_cookies', 'true');
```

The following string trait values will evaluate to `true`:

- `"True"`
- `"true"`
- `"1"`
