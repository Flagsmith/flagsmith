If you want a more configurable environment, you can manually install both the Frontend and the API.

## Server-Side API

The source code and installation instructions can be found at [the GitHub project](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith/tree/main/api). The API is written in Python and is based on Django and the Django REST Framework. The server-side API relies on a PostgreSQL installation to store its data, and a Redis installation as a cache.

## Frontend Website

The source code and installation instructions can be found at [the GitHub project](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith/tree/main/frontend). The Frontend Website is written in React/JavaScript and requires Node.js.
