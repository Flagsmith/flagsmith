# SDKs Overview

Flagsmith ships with SDKs for a bunch of different programming languages. We also have a [REST API](rest.md) that you
can use if you want to consume the API directly.

Our SDKs are split into two different groups. These SDKs have different methods of operation due to the differences in
their operating environment:

1. **Client-side** (e.g. browser-based Javascript).
2. **Server-side** (e.g. Java or Python).

:::tip

**Environment Keys** come in two different types: Client-side and Server-side keys. Make sure you use the correct key
depending on the SDK you are using.

:::

## Client-side SDKS

Client-side SDKs run in web browsers or on mobile devices. These runtimes execute within _untrusted environments_.
Anyone using the Javascript SDK in a web browser, for example, can find the Client-side SDK, create a new Identity, look
at their flags and
[potentially write Traits to the Identity](/system-administration/security#preventing-client-sdks-from-setting-traits).

Client-side SDKs are also limited to the
[types of data that they have access to](/guides-and-examples/integration-approaches#segment-and-targeting-rules-are-not-leaked-to-the-client).

Client-side Environment keys are designed to be shared publicly, for example in your HTML/JS code that is sent to a web
browser.

Client-side SDKs hit our [Edge API](../advanced-use/edge-api.md) directly to retrieve their flags.

Read more about our Client-side SDKs for your language/platform:

- [Javascript](/clients/javascript)
- [Android/Kotlin](/clients/android)
- [Flutter](/clients/flutter)
- [iOS/Swift](/clients/ios)
- [React & React Native](/clients/react)
- [Next.js, Svelte and SSR](/clients/next-ssr)

## Server-side SDKs

[Server-side SDKs](/clients/server-side) run within _trusted environments_ - typically the server infrastructure that
you have control over. Because of this, you should not share your Server-side Environment keys publicly; they should be
treated as secret.

:::tip

The Server-side SDKs can operate in 2 different modes:

1. Remote Evaluation
2. Local Evaluation

It's important to understand which mode is right for your use case, and what the pros and cons of each one are. This is
detailed below.

:::

### Remote Evaluation

In this mode, every time the SDK needs to get Flags, it will make a request to the Flagsmith API to get the Flags for
the particular request.

![Remote Evaluation Diagram](/img/sdk-remote-evaluation.svg)

Remote Evaluation is the default mode; initialise the SDK and you will be running in Remote Evaluation mode.

This is the same way that the [Client-side SDKs](#client-side-sdks) work.

### Local Evaluation

In this mode, all flag values are calculated locally, on your server. The Flagsmith SDK includes an implementation of
the Flag Engine, and the engine runs within your server environment within the Flagsmith SDK.

![Local Evaluation Diagram](/img/sdk-local-evaluation.svg)

You have to configure the SDK to run in Local Evaluation mode. See the
[SDK configuration options](server-side#configuring-the-sdk) for details on how to do that in your particular language.

When the SDK is initialised in Local Evaluation mode, it grabs the entire set of details about the Environment from the
Flagsmith API. For a given Environment, this includes:

- Flags and flag values
- Segments, segment rules, and segment overrides
- Identity overrides

This full complement of Environment data enables the Flagsmith SDK to run the Flag Engine _locally_ and _natively_
within your server infrastructure.

:::info

When using identity overrides in local evaluation:

- Keep overrides count under 1500-2000, depending on flag value size.
- Make sure your environment settings enable it.
- Provide a full set of traits when requesting identity flags.

See [Pros, Cons and Caveats](#for-local-evaluation).

:::

:::tip

The SDK has to request all of the data about an Environment in order to run. Because some of this data could be
sensitive (for example, your Segment Rules), the SDK requires a specific
[Server-side Environment Key](#server-side-sdk).

:::

The benefits to doing this are mainly one of latency and performance. Your server-side code does not need to hit the
Flagsmith API each time a user requests their flags - the flags can be computed locally. Hence it does not need to block
and wait for a response back from the Flagsmith API.

In order to keep their Environment data up-to-date, SDKs running in Local Evaluation mode will poll the Flagsmith API
regularly and update their local Environment data with any changes from the Flagsmith API. By default the SDK will poll
the Flagsmith every 60 seconds; this rate is configurable within each SDK.

It's important to understand the [pros and cons](#pros-cons-and-caveats) for running Local Evaluation.

All our Client-side SDKs run in Remote Evaluation mode only; they cannot run in Local Evaluation mode. The reason for
this is down to data sensitivity. Because some of this data could be sensitive (for example, your Segment Rules), we
only allow Client-side SDKs to run in Remote Evaluation mode.

Because Clients are almost always operating remotely from your server infrastructure, there is little benefit to them
running in Local Evaluation mode.

## Networking Model

When are network requests made, and when do you need to consider network latency? It depends on your evaluation mode,
and whether you are using Client-side or Server-side SDKs!

### Remote Evaluation Network Model

#### Client-side Network Model

- By default, client-side SDKs will initialise and retrieve all the Flags for an Environment and store them in local
  memory. Flag evaluations within the SDK are then a simple lookup in memory with no associated network call.
- If the context of an Identity changes, for example if a new Trait is added to the Identity, the SDK will make a new
  call to the Flagsmith API to update the Traits of the Identity and receive new Flags, as the value of those flags may
  have changed. This happens in one network call.
- If an entirely new Identity is provided, the SDK will make a new call to the Flagsmith API to receive new Flags.
- Other than the above two points, the SDK will not make further network requests to the Flagsmith API. If you wish you
  can manually trigger a network call in code and refresh Flags locally.

:::tip

Exact Client-side specifics of initialisation and Flag retrieval depends on the language and platform. Check the docs
for the relevant language platform for details.

:::

#### Server-side Network Model

- Flagsmith server-side SDKs do not store Flags in local memory. Every Flag evaluation in your code will trigger a
  network request.

If this approach does not work for you (generally for reasons of latency or overly chatty networking) you should
consider Local Evaluation mode (explained below) or the [Edge Proxy](/advanced-use/edge-proxy).

### Local Evaluation Network Model

Local Evaluation mode is only available with Server-side SDKs.

- When the SDK is initialised, it will make a network request to the Flagsmith API to receive all the Environment data
  it needs to run Local Evaluations. The SDK receives a single JSON document with all this data.
- Future evaluations are all computed locally within the SDK runtime. This means they are extremely fast as there is no
  network latency to account for.
- No further network calls take place for 60 seconds.
- After 60 seconds have elapsed, the SDK will refresh the JSON Environment Document with a network call to the Flagsmith
  API.

## The Environment Document

The Environment Document in the context of Flagsmith is a structured JSON file containing all the configuration settings
for feature flags within a single Environment, such as development, staging, and production. It typically includes
details like feature names, identities, rules, and associated metadata.

This document serves as a source of truth for managing feature flags across various situations, allowing developers to
easily control feature rollout and behaviour without redeploying code. JSON Environment Documents are primarily used
with Local Evaluation and Offline Mode.

The Environment Document schema can be found in our [Swagger docs](https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/docs/) - search for
`/api/v1/environment-document`.

A sample document is below.

## API Keys

Flagsmith has three different type of SDK Key.

### Client-Side SDK

Client-side SDK Keys give both client-side SDKs and server-side SDKs access to [Remote Evaluation](#remote-evaluation)
mode.

These keys are not secret and can be considered public.

### Server-Side SDK

Server-side SDK Keys give server-side SDKs access to [Local Evaluation](#remote-evaluation) mode.

These keys are secret and should not be shared.

### Management API

Management API keys are used to interact with the Flagsmith API directly. These keys can be used in the following
situations:

- If you want to work with Flagsmith programatically, for example when creating and deleting Environments as part of a
  CI/CD process.
- When using the [Terraform Provider](/integrations/terraform).

These keys are secret and should not be shared.

### Client-side SDK approaches

Since Client-side SDKs will generally be associated with a single Identity (the person who owns the client device!), a
common pattern for networking implementation is:

1. The user launches your application for the first time. Since your application does not know who they are, a call to
   get the default Environment Flags is made by the Flagsmith SDK.
2. After the user logs in, make a second request to get the Flags with the new user Identity.
3. Cache these flags locally on the device.
4. Upon subsequent application launches, immediately read the flags from the cached store from step 3 and use those as
   your application Flag values.
5. In the background make a request to Flagsmith to refresh their Flags.
6. Update both your application and the local cache with these fresh flags.

### Things to note

- Flagsmith always returns **all** Environment Flags during API calls. In fact, there is no way to request the state of
  a single flag via our API.
- The 60 second polling time in Local Evaluation mode is configurable.
- You can provide your own caching layer (with a short TTL) in front of Local Evaluation mode requests if you wish -
  this is not uncommon.

## Pros, Cons and Caveats

### For Remote Evaluation

- Identities are persisted within the Flagsmith Datastore.
- Identity overrides specified within the Dashboard.
- All Integrations work as designed.

### For Local Evaluation

:::tip

When running in Local Evaluation mode, our SDKs expect to be run as long-lived processes. Serverless platforms like AWS
Lambda either break this contract or make it much more complicated. As a result, we do not recommend running our SDKs in
Local Evaluation mode on top of platforms like Lambda where you do not have complete control over process lifetimes.

Our [Edge Proxy](/advanced-use/edge-proxy/) is a good candidate if you need to run local evaluation mode alongside
serverless platforms.

:::

The benefit of running in Local Evaluation mode is that you can process flag evaluations much more efficiently as they
are all computed locally.

- Make sure **Environment Settings > SDK Settings > Use identity overrides in local evaluation** is toggled on. To keep
  evaluation consistent, it's off by default for projects created before January 2024.
- Identities and their Traits are **not** read from or written to the Flagsmith API, and so are not persisted in the
  datastore. This means that you have to provide the full complement of Traits when requesting the Flags for a
  particular Identity. Our SDKs all provide relevant methods to achieve this.
- [Analytics-based Integrations](/integrations#analytics-platforms) do not run.
  [Flag Analytics](/advanced-use/flag-analytics) do still work, if enabled within the
  [SDK setup](/clients/server-side#configuring-the-sdk).
- Currently, Flagsmith SDKs support up to 1500-2000 identity overrides, depending on flag value sizes, when used with
  Edge API. If you store more than 1MB of override data, you will need to query the Edge API endpoint directly and use
  pagination:

```bash
curl https://edge.api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/environment-document \
  -H 'x-environment-key: <Your Server-Side Env Key>' \
  --verbose
```

The `link` response header will contain the url to next page:

```
content-type: application/json
...
link: </api/v1/environment-document/?page_id=identity_override%3A60074%lastreadid>; rel="next"
...
```
