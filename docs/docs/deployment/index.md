## Flagsmith SaaS Platform

If you would rather skip the hosting and jump straight to integrating Flagsmith with your own application, you can use
[https://flagsmith.com/](https://flagsmith.com/) right now. We have
[paid plans with pricing to suit both startups and enterprise customers alike](https://flagsmith.com/pricing).

## Terraform Templates

We have a number of example deployments across different providers and orchestration frameworks in our
[Terraform Examples](https://github.com/Flagsmith/terraform-examples) repository.

## One Click Installers

[![Deploy to Dome](https://trydome.io/button.svg)](https://app.trydome.io/signup?package=flagsmith)

[![Deploy to DigitalOcean](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith/tree/main)

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/flagsmith/flagsmith/tree/main)

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/36mGw8?referralCode=DGxv1S)

![Fly.io](/img/logos/fly.io.svg)

We're big fans of [Fly.io](https://Fly.io)! You can deploy to fly.io really easily:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Flagsmith/flagsmith.git
cd flagsmith
flyctl postgres create --name flagsmith-flyio-db
flyctl apps create flagsmith-flyio
flyctl postgres attach --postgres-app flagsmith-flyio-db
flyctl deploy
```

Fly.io has a global application namespace, and so you may need to change the name of the application defined in
[`fly.toml`](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith/blob/main/fly.toml) as well as the commands above.

### Caprover

You can also deploy to a [Caprover Server](https://caprover.com/) with
[One Click Apps](https://caprover.com/docs/one-click-apps.html).

## Self Hosting Overview

You will need to run through the following steps to get set up:

1. Create a Postgres database to store the Flagsmith data.
2. Deploy the API and set up DNS for it. If you are using health-checks, make sure to use `/health` as the health-check
   endpoint.
3. Visit `http://<your-server-domain:8000>/api/v1/users/config/init/` to create an initial Superuser and provide DNS
   info to the platform.
4. Deploy the Front End Dashboard and set up DNS for it. Point the Dashboard to the API using the relevant Environment
   Variables. If you are using health-checks, make sure to use `/health` as the health-check endpoint.
5. Create a new Organisation, Project, Environment and Flags via the Dashboard.
6. When using our SDKs, you will need to override the API URL that they point to, otherwise they will default to connect
   to our paid-for API at `https://edge.api.flagsmith.com/api/v1`. See the SDK documentation for the library you are
   using.

## Deployment Options

We recommend running Flagsmith with [Docker](/deployment/hosting/docker). We have options to run within
[Docker](/deployment/hosting/docker), [Kubernetes](/deployment/hosting/kubernetes) or
[RedHat OpenShift](/deployment/hosting/openshift).

## Architecture

The Flagsmith architecture is based around a REST API that is accessed by both SDK clients and the Flagsmith Dashboard
Front End Web App.

![Application Architecture](/img/self-hosted-architecture.svg)

## Dependencies

Running the API has the following hard dependencies:

- Postgres database - the main data store. Postgres 12 or later is required.

The API can also optionally make use of the following 3rd party services:

- Google Analytics - for API analytics
- InfluxDB - for API analytics
- SendGrid - for transactional email
- AWS S3 - to store Django Static Assets
- GitHub - OAuth provider
- Google - OAuth provider

## Flag Analytics

Flagsmith stores time series data for two use cases:

1. Flag Analytics
2. API traffic reporting

Flagsmith can be configured to store and process this data in one of three ways:

1. To store it in Postgres
2. To store it in InfluxDB
3. To not store it at all

We recommend option 1.

### Time series data via Postgres

Add the following environment variables to the Flagsmith API service:

```bash
# Set Postgres to store the data
USE_POSTGRES_FOR_ANALYTICS=True

# Configure the postgres datastore:
# Either
ANALYTICS_DATABASE_URL (e.g. postgresql://postgres:password@postgres:5432/flagsmith)
# Or
DJANGO_DB_HOST_ANALYTICS (e.g. postgres.db)
DJANGO_DB_NAME_ANALYTICS (e.g. flagsmith)
DJANGO_DB_USER_ANALYTICS (e.g. postgres_user)
DJANGO_DB_PASSWORD_ANALYTICS (e.g. postgres_password)
DJANGO_DB_PORT_ANALYTICS (e.g. 5432)
```

Note that you don't have to use the same database or database server as the core Flagsmith DB.

You will also need to be running the [Task Processor](/deployment/configuration/task-processor) for downsampling to work
and the stats to start showing up in the dashboard. This process can take up to 1 hour.

## API Telemetry

Flagsmith collects information about self hosted installations. This helps us understand how the platform is being used.
This data is _never_ shared outside of the organisation, and is anonymous by design. You can opt out of sending this
telemetry on startup by setting the `ENABLE_TELEMETRY` environment variable to `False`.

We collect the following data on startup and then once every 8 hours per API server instance:

- Total number of Organisations
- Total number of Projects
- Total number of Environments
- Total number of Features
- Total number of Segments
- Total number of Users
- DEBUG django variable
- ENV django variable
- API server external IP address

## Running Flagsmith on Flagsmith

Flagsmith uses Flagsmith to control features on the front end dashboard. If you are self hosting the platform, you will
sometimes see features greyed out, or you may want to disable specific features, e.g. logging in via Google and GitHub.
If you are using your own Flagsmith environment then you will need to have a replica of our flags in order to control
access to those features.

To do this,firstly create a new project within your self-hosted Flagsmith application. This is the project that we will
use to control the features of the self-hosted Flagsmith instance. We will then point the self hosted front end
dashboard at this Flagsmith project in order to control what features show for your self hosted Flagsmith instance.

Once you have created the project, you need to set the following
[Front End](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith-frontend) environment variables in order to configure this:

- `FLAGSMITH_ON_FLAGSMITH_API_KEY`
  - The Flagsmith Client-side Environment Key we use to manage features - Flagsmith runs on Flagsmith. This will be the
    API key for the project you created as instructed above.
- `ENABLE_FLAGSMITH_REALTIME`
  - Determines whether the Flagsmith on Flagsmith SDK uses Realtime.
- `FLAGSMITH_ON_FLAGSMITH_API_URL`
  - The API URL which the Flagsmith front end dashboard should communicate with. This will most likely be the domain
    name of the Flagsmith API you are self hosting: Flagsmith runs on Flagsmith. E.g. For our SaaS hosted platform, the
    variable is `https://edge.api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/`. For example, if you were running everything locally using the
    standard [docker-compose setup](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith-docker), you would use
    `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/`

Once you have set this up, you should see the Flagsmith front end requesting its own flags from the API (you can look in
your browser developer console to see this). You can now start creating flags and overriding the default behaviours of
the platform. For example, if you wanted to disable Google OAuth authentication, you would create a flag called
`oauth_google` and disable it.

### `oauth_github`

Find instructions for GitHub Authentication [here](/system-administration/authentication/OAuth#github).

Create an OAuth application in the GitHub Developer Console and then provide the following as the Flag value:

- Create the Flagsmith on Flagsmith flag as below replacing your `client_id` and `redirect_uri`

```json
{
 "url": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?scope=user&client_id=<your client_id>&redirect_uri=<your url encoded redirect uri>"
}
```

For example, our SaaS value looks like this (but with our Client ID redacted)

```json
{
 "url": "https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?scope=user&client_id=999999999999&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.flagsmith.com%2Foauth%2Fgithub"
}
```

### `oauth_google`

Create an OAuth application in the Google Developer Console and then provide the following as the Flag value:

```json
{
 "clientId": "<Your Google oAuth Client ID>"
}
```

If you are using the [unified Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/flagsmith/flagsmith), which serves
both the API and the frontend through Django, ensure you configure the following environment variable in your
deployment:

```
DJANGO_SECURE_CROSS_ORIGIN_OPENER_POLICY=same-origin-allow-popups
```

For those hosting the frontend independently, make sure you set the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` to
`same-origin-allow-popups` for Google OAuth flow to work.

### Dark Mode

We also have a Segment that manages the ui Dark Mode:

Segment Name: `dark_mode` Segment Rules: Trait `dark_mode` EXACTLY MATCHES `True`

Then use this rule to override the `dark_mode` Feature Flag.

## Integrations

Some [Integrations](/integrations) require additional configuration

### Slack Integration

Create a private Slack app. You will then need to provide the following environment variables on the API side:

- `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`
- `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`

You can retrieve these values from Slack. You will also need to add the following scopes:

- `channels:read`
- `chat:write`
- `chat:write.public`

You will also need to set up the redirect URLs for your application. For more information on this see Slack's docs on
creating your own app, and the OAuth flow that goes along with that. The production Flagsmith App Manifest reads as
follows and can be used as a template:

```json
{
 "display_information": {
  "name": "Flagsmith Bot",
  "description": "Get notified in Slack whenever changes are made to your Flagsmith Environments",
  "background_color": "#000000",
  "long_description": "Use our application for Slack to receive Flagsmith state changes directly in your Slack channels. Whenever you create, update or delete a Flag within Flagsmith, our application for Slack will send a message into a Slack channel of your choosing.\r\n\r\nFlagsmith is an open source, fully featured, Feature Flag and Remote Config service. Use our hosted API, deploy to your own private cloud, or run on-premise."
 },
 "features": {
  "bot_user": {
   "display_name": "Flagsmith Bot",
   "always_online": false
  }
 },
 "oauth_config": {
  "redirect_urls": [
   "https://api.flagsmith.com/api/v1/environments",
   "https://api-staging.flagsmith.com/api/v1/environments"
  ],
  "scopes": {

  }
 },

 }
}
```

### Time series data via InfluxDB

Flagsmith has a soft dependency on InfluxDB to store time-series data. You don't need to configure Influx to run the
platform; by default this data will be stored in Postgres. If you are running very high traffic loads, you might be
interested in deploying InfluxDB.

1. Create a user account in influxdb. You can visit [http://localhost:8086/]
2. Go into Data > Buckets and create three new buckets called `default`, `default_downsampled_15m` and
   `default_downsampled_1h`
3. Go into Data > Tokens and grab your access token.
4. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and add the following `environment` variables in the api service to connect the
   api to InfluxDB:
   - `INFLUXDB_TOKEN`: The token from the step above
   - `INFLUXDB_URL`: `http://influxdb`
   - `INFLUXDB_ORG`: The organisation ID - you can find it
     [here](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/organizations/view-orgs/)
   - `INFLUXDB_BUCKET`: `default`
5. Restart `docker-compose`
6. Create a new task with the following query. This will downsample your per millisecond api request data down to 15
   minute blocks for faster queries. Set it to run every 15 minutes.

```text
option task = {name: "Downsample (API Requests)", every: 15m}

data = from(bucket: "default")
 |> range(start: -duration(v: int(v: task.every) * 2))
 |> filter(fn: (r) =>
  (r._measurement == "api_call"))

data
 |> aggregateWindow(fn: sum, every: 15m)
 |> filter(fn: (r) =>
  (exists r._value))
 |> to(bucket: "default_downsampled_15m")
```

Once this task has run you will see data coming into the Organisation API Usage area.

7. Create another new task with the following query. This will downsample your per millisecond flag evaluation data down
   to 15 minute blocks for faster queries. Set it to run every 15 minutes.

```text
option task = {name: "Downsample (Flag Evaluations)", every: 15m}

data = from(bucket: "default")
 |> range(start: -duration(v: int(v: task.every) * 2))
 |> filter(fn: (r) =>
  (r._measurement == "feature_evaluation"))

data
 |> aggregateWindow(fn: sum, every: 15m)
 |> filter(fn: (r) =>
  (exists r._value))
 |> to(bucket: "default_downsampled_15m")
```

Once this task has run, and you have made some flag evaluations with analytics enabled (see documentation
[here](/advanced-use/flag-analytics.md) for information on this) you should see data in the 'Analytics' tab against each
feature in your dashboard.

8. Create another new task with the following query. This will downsample your per millisecond api request data down to
   1 hour blocks for faster queries. Set it to run every 1 hour.

```text
option task = {name: "Downsample API 1h", every: 1h}

data = from(bucket: "default")
 |> range(start: -duration(v: int(v: task.every) * 2))
 |> filter(fn: (r) =>
  (r._measurement == "api_call"))

data
 |> aggregateWindow(fn: sum, every: 1h)
    |> filter(fn: (r) =>
      (exists r._value))
 |> to(bucket: "default_downsampled_1h")
```

9. Create another new task with the following query. This will downsample your per millisecond flag evaluation data down
   to 1 hour blocks for faster queries. Set it to run every 1 hour.

```text
option task = {name: "Downsample API 1h - Flag Analytics", every: 1h}

data = from(bucket: "default")
 |> range(start: -duration(v: int(v: task.every) * 2))
 |> filter(fn: (r) =>
  (r._measurement == "feature_evaluation"))
 |> filter(fn: (r) =>
  (r._field == "request_count"))
 |> group(columns: ["feature_id", "environment_id"])

data
 |> aggregateWindow(fn: sum, every: 1h)
    |> filter(fn: (r) =>
      (exists r._value))
 |> set(key: "_measurement", value: "feature_evaluation")
 |> set(key: "_field", value: "request_count")
 |> to(bucket: "default_downsampled_1h")
```

## Manual Installation

If you want a more configurable environment, you can manually install both the Front End and the API.

### Server Side API

The source code and installation instructions can be found at
[the GitHub project](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith/tree/main/api). The API is written in Python and is based on
Django and the Django Rest Framework. The Server side API relies on a Postgres SQL installation to store its data, and a
Redis installation as a cache.

### Front End Website

The source code and installation instructions can be found at
[the GitHub project](https://github.com/Flagsmith/flagsmith/tree/main/frontend). The Front End Website is written in
React/Javascript and requires NodeJS.
