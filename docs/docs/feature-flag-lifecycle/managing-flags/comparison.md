# Understanding Feature Flag Comparison

Flagsmith provides powerful comparison tools to help you understand how your flags are configured across different environments. This is essential for maintaining consistency and preventing configuration errors across your deployment pipeline.

## Environment Comparison

Use the **Compare** menu to analyze flag configurations between environments:

### Use Cases
- Audit changes before promoting to production
- Identify configuration discrepancies
- Verify environment-specific overrides
- Check segment targeting consistency

### What to Compare
- Flag states (enabled/disabled)
- Flag values and configurations
- Segment overrides
- Multivariate settings

## Flag Comparison

View a single flag's configuration across all environments:

### Key Benefits
- Ensure consistent configuration
- Track environment-specific variations
- Debug environment-specific issues
- Validate deployment changes

### Best Practices
- Compare before promoting changes
- Verify segment configurations
- Check multivariate weightings
- Review environment-specific overrides

## Regular Comparison Workflow

1. **Pre-deployment**
   - Compare staging to production
   - Verify segment configurations
   - Check value consistency

2. **Post-deployment**
   - Validate changes were applied
   - Verify environment overrides
   - Confirm segment targeting

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regular environment audits
   - Configuration consistency checks
   - Document any intended differences

Regularly comparing flags helps maintain a reliable and predictable release process while preventing configuration drift between environments.
