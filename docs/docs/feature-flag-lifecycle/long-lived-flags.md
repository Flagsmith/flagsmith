# Long-Lived Feature Flags

Long-lived flags are permanent flags that remain in your application indefinitely. They're used for ongoing feature management and operational control.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Kill Switches

Kill switches are emergency controls that let you disable features or entire system components:

- Disable problematic features quickly
- Manage system load during incidents
- Control access during maintenance
- Implement graceful degradation

For example:
```javascript
if (flagsmith.hasFeature("maintenance_mode")) {
    showMaintenancePage();
} else {
    showNormalContent();
}
```

### 2. Feature Management

Use flags with [segments](./segments.md) to control feature access:

- Toggle features by subscription tier
- Enable features for specific user groups
- Control feature access by region/locale
- Manage feature availability by app version

Example with segments:
```javascript
// User with enterprise_plan trait will see the feature
if (flagsmith.hasFeature("advanced_analytics")) {
    showEnterpriseFeatures();
}
```

### 3. Configuration Management

Use flag values to manage configuration:

- API endpoint URLs
- System limits and thresholds
- Feature configuration parameters
- Regional settings

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Naming and Organization

Use clear, permanent-focused names:
```
feature_enterprise_analytics
kill_switch_api_v2
config_rate_limit
```

Use [tags](/advanced-use/flag-management.md#tagging) for organization:
- `kill-switch`
- `config`
- `permanent`

### 2. Documentation

Document thoroughly:
- Purpose and use cases
- Impact when disabled
- Related segments/configurations
- Owner and responsible team

### 3. Protection Mechanisms

Prevent accidental changes:
- Use [protected tags](/advanced-use/flag-management.md#tagging)
- Implement [Change Requests](/advanced-use/change-requests.md)
- Assign [Flag Owners](/advanced-use/flag-management.md#flag-owners)
- Use clear warning labels

### 4. Monitoring

Keep track of usage and impact:
- Monitor through [Flag Analytics](/advanced-use/flag-analytics.md)
- Set up alerts for critical flag changes
- Track dependencies in your system
- Regular audits of flag states

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Regular Review**
   - Validate flag configuration monthly
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Review segment rules and conditions
   - Check for obsolete configurations

2. **Testing**
   - Regular testing of kill switches
   - Validate segment rules
   - Test default states
   - Verify degradation paths

3. **Change Management**
   - Use [Change Requests](/advanced-use/change-requests.md) for updates
   - Schedule changes during low-impact windows
   - Coordinate changes across teams
   - Document all modifications

4. **Cleanup**
   - Archive truly obsolete flags
   - Consolidate similar flags
   - Remove unused segments
   - Update documentation
