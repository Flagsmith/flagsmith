# Reporting Security Issues

Please report any security issues you discover to support[at]flagsmith[dot]com

We will assess the risk and, if required, take the following actions:

- Identify the remediation.
- Implement and deploy a fix to our SaaS platform, Docker images and source code.
- Create a Github issue, labelled `Security` where appropriate.

Thank you for your contribution.
