IMPORTANT: Before starting, always run `/api-types-sync` to ensure frontend types are in sync with the backend.

Generate a new API service. Follow these steps:

1. Run `/api-types-sync` to sync types with the backend (compares with latest backend in main)
2. Go through the process mentioned in `.claude/context/api-integration.md`
3. If I haven't specified, attempt to find where I'd want to create this component in the frontend
