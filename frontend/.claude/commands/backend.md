description: Search the backend codebase for endpoint details
---

Search the `../api` codebase for the requested endpoint.

Look for:
1. Route definitions (URL path)
2. HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
3. Request validation schema (request body/params types)
4. Response structure (what data is returned)
5. Authentication/authorization requirements

If the endpoint isn't found, check swagger docs: https://staging-api.hoxtonmix.com/api/v3/docs/
